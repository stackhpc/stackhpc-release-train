# Due to a bug in Pulp (https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/issues/2311), we can
# end up with multiple publications for a single repository version after
# performing a sync. This breaks assumptions in the Pulp squeezer modules about
# uniqueness, causing the rpm_publication module to fail, and breaking sync
# jobs.
#
# This playbook looks for repository versions with multiple publications, and
# removes the most recent.

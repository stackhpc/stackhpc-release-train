# Usage - access control

Access control is primarily managed using the Ansible playbooks and configuration in the [stackhpc-release-train](https://github.com/stackhpc/stackhpc-release-train) and [stackhpc-release-train-clients](https://github.com/stackhpc/stackhpc-release-train-clients) repositories.
The readme file in each repository provides information on how to install dependencies and run playbooks.
The playbooks are designed to be run manually or via a GitHub Actions CI job.
This page covers the different workflows available for access control.

## Create content guards

This workflow must currently be run manually.
It involves the following playbook in the [stackhpc-release-train](https://github.com/stackhpc/stackhpc-release-train) repository:

* `dev-pulp-content-guards.yml`: Create RBAC content-guards.

It should almost never need to be run.

To run it manually:

```
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory \
ansible/dev-pulp-content-guards.yml
```

Configuration for content guards is in [ansible/inventory/group_vars/all/dev-pulp-repos](https://github.com/stackhpc/stackhpc-release-train/blob/main/ansible/inventory/group_vars/all/dev-pulp-repos).

## Generating client credentials

Clients require credentials in order to access Ark.
See the README in the [stackhpc-release-train-clients](https://github.com/stackhpc/stackhpc-release-train-clients) repository for how to generate and update them.
It is also possible to use this repository to generate credentials with access to the unpromoted "development" content, but these should not be given to clients.
